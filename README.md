# Web Development Project 3 - _FLASHCARDS PART TWO_

Submitted by: **FRANCIS EYANAE**

This web app: **In Flashcards! Part 1, you chose pairs of items to store in a flashcard-like format that users can use to study, learn something new, or play a guessing game. This week, you will extend the functionality of your web app! You will build features that allow users to enter an answer (with exact or fuzzy matching) and move backwards and forwards through the list of cards.**

Time spent: **35** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card**
