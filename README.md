# FLASHCARDS PART TWO

In Flashcards! Part 1, you chose pairs of items to store in a flashcard-like format that users can use to study, learn something new, or play a guessing game. This week, you will extend the functionality of your web app! You will build features that allow users to enter an answer (with exact or fuzzy matching) and move backwards and forwards through the list of cards.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
